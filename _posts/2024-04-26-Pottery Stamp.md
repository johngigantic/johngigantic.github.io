My mother, as an amateur potter, was filling boxes upon boxes with pots she'd made, and giving them to friends as "angry pots." She'd include a note encouraging the recipient to hold on to it until a day when they felt particularly irate, at which point they were to smash it on the sidewalk as hard as they could, before cleaning up and calling my mother to chat, and to obtain a free replacement pot for their next episode of rage. A more interactive, single-use stress ball, if you will.

Later on, my friend Hans was showing me his pottery studio, and I the maker's mark stamped on all his work. It was a neat little glyph that referenced his initials & ancestry. I was inspired to create one for my mother. I asked Hans for tips on making a good stamp and filled several pages with logograms of her name, initials and other sketches.

I noticed that her first initial, K, turned on its side, seemed like a mouth and eyebrows (kind of like this unicode character: ⚍ ) and a rectangular box around the letter made it seem like the character Anger from the movie Inside Out. I played more with the arrangement of the pen strokes and borders until I settled on an arrangement that I liked.

I refined the design a little more with Hans's tips: 
- Sharp interior corners can tend to get smushed and clay can stick in the grooves
- Avoid large, thick fill sections, and stick to thinner lines to preserve more details
- Use a sturdy material, like brass.

I then took a photo, used Adobe to convert into vector, and thickened the lines to feel sort of hand-drawn and ragged, like torn paper or a postage stamp. Here's what I ended up coming up with - the K, and on its side, the angry face.

I researched places to buy custom pottery stamps and ended up going with [4clay.com](https://4clay.com/). They have a custom designed material which they claim is better than brass. I don't have enough experience to verify this, but it seems like it's worked well so far. I also liked that their examples seemed pretty crisp, they were manufactured in the USA, and that their website was nice and janky.
