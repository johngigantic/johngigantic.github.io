The Great Salt Lake has a wildly cool natural history. Its satellite view is also quite unusual - a causeway separates the north and south halves of the lake, causing different salinity levels where different algae grow, which can be pinpointed easily in satellite imagery. Some years it's red.

It's also quite cool because of what it once was: Lake Bonneville. In the Pleistocene (about 15,000 years ago), this body of water was over 300m deep and covered nearly 20,000 mi², almost a quarter of the whole state of Utah. In Salt Lake City, and around many other regions of the state, you can still see and hike on the prehistoric shoreline, a bathtub ring of cliffs around the state's more fertile lowlands. And in a particularly dramatic moment (perhaps after an earthquake, some theorize), the entire lake bust through a natural dam and caused an outburst flood, draining all at once into the snake river valley. 

They really do have a fascinating history and have some good wikipedia pages - go nuts.

Today it is well as a significant climate risk to Utah's population. A 2023 estimate gave the lake just 5 years before it would dry up. Salt Lake City depends on this lake as a water source, and the dust released by dry lakebeds can pose a significant health risk.

Another Wikipedia excerpt:

    A non-binding resolution in the 2023 state legislative session to adopt 4,198 feet was voted down and governor Spencer Cox called it "dumb".<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Salt_Lake#cite_note-28" target="_blank" rel="noopener">[28]</a>

Anyways, if it's up for debate, I'd like to get my two cents in, as I personally think that we should raise the water level back to the original maximum height of 5090ft. I'm all for reversing climate change however we can. Also, we could really use the water, and I'm sure the skiing would get even better snow from the lake effect.

My dad and I were chatting about this and he suggested it was worth making some stickers, inspired by "Keep Tahoe Blue."

I looked around until I found a map that showed all the water levels of its four major stages, not just at the peak: ["Major levels of Great Salt Lake and Lake Bonneville (M-73),"](https://ia.eferrit.com/ea/8371310dc6d911a1.pdf) published by the USGS. I found a PDF file, and while I saw it for sale by the [Utah DNR Map Store](https://utahmapstore.com/products/m-73), it's out of stock, and probably not published anymore.

I used Adobe to convert the water level map to blobs which help show off the depth, overlayed it on the state, and printed a thousand stickers. So if you see me, let me know if you want one.
